# Form

Building forms with React Hook Form and Zod. Visit [**Docs**](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form) to know every detail.

Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Has support for client and server side validation.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
"use client";

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { z } from "zod";

import { Button } from "mycomponentsui";
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormDescription,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "mycomponentsui";
import { Input } from "mycomponentsui";
import { toast } from "mycomponentsui";

const FormSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2, {
    message: "Username must be at least 2 characters.",
  }),
});

export function InputForm() {
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof FormSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(FormSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      username: "",
    },
  });

  function onSubmit(data: z.infer<typeof FormSchema>) {
    toast({
      title: "You submitted the following values:",
      description: (
        <pre className='mt-2 w-[340px] rounded-md bg-slate-950 p-4'>
          <code className='text-white'>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</code>
        </pre>
      ),
    });
  }

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className='w-2/3 space-y-6'>
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name='username'
          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Input placeholder='shadcn' {...field} />
              </FormControl>
              <FormDescription>
                This is your public display name.
              </FormDescription>
              <FormMessage />
            </FormItem>
          )}
        />
        <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
}
```
